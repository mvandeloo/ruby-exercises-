inspect to words

Task at Makersacademy (from end of August):

Reopen the Fixnum class. Override the method inspect to return a word ('one', 'two', etc.) for number zero to 9 and a number for anything else

0.inspect #=> "zero" 1.inspect #=> "one"

and so on
9.inspect #=> "nine" 10.inspect #=> "10" 11.inspect #=> "11"

and so on
